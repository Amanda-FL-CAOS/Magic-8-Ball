# 🎱 Magic 8 Ball in Python

This is a simple Python implementation of the classic **Magic 8 Ball** toy — the one you shake to get answers to your yes-or-no questions. Just type your question, and the program will give you a randomized, mystical response!

## 💡 Features

- Asks the user for a yes/no question
- Randomly selects one of 9 possible responses
- Simulates the behavior of a real Magic 8 Ball

## 🧠 What I learned

This project helped me practice and apply:

1. **User input**  
   Handling interactive input using `input()` to capture user questions.

2. **Random number generation**  
   Using `random.randint()` to generate unpredictable answers, adding a sense of fun and uncertainty.

3. **Conditional logic**  
   Writing `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to manage different outcomes based on the random number.

## 🛠️ How to run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Save the script as `magic8ball.py`.
3. Run it in the terminal or a Python IDE:

```bash
python magic8ball.py
